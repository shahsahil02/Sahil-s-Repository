BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a structured naming convention.
Block: Represents a standalone entity, e.g., block.
Element: Represents a part of the block, e.g., block__element.
Modifier: Represents a different state or version of a block or element, e.g., block--modifier.
Example: block__element--modifier clearly defines relationships and states.
