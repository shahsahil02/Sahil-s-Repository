    <p>I’m quoting a real-life incident of a king who was a king by day and a blacksmith by night. Despite having all the wealth and sacred treasures of the earth, he chose to lead a hardworking life and feed himself with his own hands. His name was David, God’s chosen one, and his life inspires me to become a jewelry designer. 

        I’m also a UI/UX designer, but my passion for design never ends. I like to stay updated on my work and skills, so I’m currently in a development stage, working to upgrade my abilities and refine my design instincts.
        
        Managing skills is something that we humans naturally develop throughout our lives. To better manage my professional work, I’ve taken the initiative to learn project management skills.
        
        Time is what drives us, and this realization makes me more passionate about life, as I know it will come to an end someday. To help track time, I have some knowledge in the field of watchmaking.
        
        I prefer being more practical than technical in terms of communication, as effective communication is essential in every part of any industry. A failure to understand can suppress the inner talent of an individual, even if they are a highly skilled professional.</p>
