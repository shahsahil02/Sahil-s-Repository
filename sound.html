    <h1 style="text-align: center;">WHAT IS CYMATICS?</h1>

<p>Simply put, cymatics is the field of study that focuses on visible vibrations and sounds.

    Formerly catalogued as a subset of modal phenomena, cymatics may be evidence of the universal interconnectivity of all things.
    
    Some see it as “geometry in motion” and it’s a great method of seeing the previously unseen, much like the microscope and the sonogram.
    
    Although a lot of intelligent individuals are responsible for uncovering the mysteries behind cymatics, you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to start peering through the window yourself.
    
    Additionally, you don’t need to have a bank account big enough to buy a building-sized machine either; something as simple as vibration is enough to shake the universe into telling us more about itself.
     
    UNDERSTANDING SOUND
    When something vibrates, a guitar string, for example, energy is created and the atmosphere around the source reacts in the same way. That wave then travels through the air, into the ear and it then resonates the eardrum.
    
    Finally, the signal makes its way to the brain, where it is processed as sound.
    
    At the molecular level, everything vibrates.
    
    However, healthy human hearing can only perceive between 20Hz and 20kHz, meaning there’s an unquantifiable amount of sound in the universe that we can’t hear.
    
    This caused some of the smartest, most curious minds in history to take that fact as a challenge and they strived to understand what was beyond the human ear.
    
    Some of them managed to take this even further and figured out that hearing sound wasn’t our limit; that if we knew how to approach it, we could also see it.
