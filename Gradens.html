    <p>If a fantasy stone "vibranium" and a villa made of bricks and stone make us so proud to live on this earth forever, then there must be someone who speaks the truth and is beyond human intelligence.</p>

        <h1>God never lies</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 24px;">The description of heaven is no less than a fantasy movie, narrated by someone whose intelligence is far superior to anyone else's.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 24 px;">“Allah has promised to Believers, men and women, gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein, and beautiful mansions in gardens of everlasting bliss. But the greatest bliss is the good pleasure of Allah: that is the supreme felicity” (9:72).</p>
<p>Jannah is as wide as the heavens and the earth (3:133). 
    <br>The people of Jannah will live in beautiful mansions (9:72)
    <br> amidst gardens with flowing streams (2:25). 
    <br>Jannah contains springs (15:45), 
    <br>dense shrubbery (80:30), 
    <br>deepening shade (4:57), 
    <br>and bunches of fruit hanging low within reach (76:14).

    The people of Jannah will have abundant food and drink (38:51). 
    <br>They will eat fruits, meats, and whatever is desired (52:22). 
    <br>They will drink from rivers of pure water, milk, wine and honey (47:15).
    <br> The wine of paradise will be “crystal-white, delicious to those who drink, free from intoxication…” (37:46-47)
    
    The people of Jannah will wear bracelets of gold and pearl and green garments of fine silk and brocade. They will recline on adorned couches (18:31) 
    <br>and raised thrones, and the weather will always be mild (76:13).</p>

    <h1>Do you still love the superhuman strength of black panther,Superman?</h1>
    <h2>Here's something you need to know about the truth and a real consiusness that has been created by the almighty creator</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 100px;">The people of paradise will always be healthy and will never feel fatigue (15:48).</p>
