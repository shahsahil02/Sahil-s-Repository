<p><strong>Why did Allah send the Quran?</strong><br><br>
Allah sent the Quran to His Messenger, to guide people and bring them forth from darkness to light by the will of their Lord. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning): 
    “(This is) a Book which We have revealed unto you (O Muhammad) in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness (of disbelief and polytheism) into light (of belief in the Oneness of Allah and Islâmic Monotheism) by their Lord’s Leave to the path of the All Mighty, the Owner of all praise” [Ibrahim 14:1]</p>
